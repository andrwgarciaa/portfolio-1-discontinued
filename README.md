# Welcome to my portfolio page

Currently preferred for desktop.
Responsiveness is working but far from perfect.

This project was an experiment to test out my knowledge of React, and now it is discontinued due to the complex code and bad implementation of React components and hooks.
New version of portfolio project is expected.

Repo discontinued due to an error which I can't figure out. Website moved to https://github.com/andrwgarciaa/portfolio-1-final
This repo is being left alive to keep the commits for learning and improving.
